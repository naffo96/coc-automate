# COC automation

## Description
A simple sequence of automated actions created to complete a Clash of Clans quest, cycling through different profiles.
An easy machine learning algorithm was developed in order to find the coordinates of an element in the game. 
Timers were used to wait for game responses and loading.

## Installation
No particular actions are needed. The program can be launched from the main module.

## Usage
It's necessary to log in from the main profile and have 3 other profiles available and logged as well, from the laptop COC application.
Coordinates are fixed for my laptop resolution (HP PAVILLON) --> If the main module is launched from another laptop,
it's necessary to get the new coordinates (through the "fidn coordinates" module) and modify them in the coordinates arrays on top.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
Actually working with 3 side-accounts, could be improved with no dependency from fixed coordinates.
